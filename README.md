## Styled-Gel

[BBC Gel Grid](https://github.com/bbc/gel-grid) over [Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com/).

Lightweight bootstrap like grid system that uses [flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/).

If like me, you still think about grids in terms of bootstrap, `Row`, `Col`, `xs`, `sm`, 'md', `lg` and `xl`, then look no further.

### usage

```
  <Grid>
    <Row>
      <Col xs={12} md={4}>Foo bar</Col>
    </Row>
  </Grid>
```
